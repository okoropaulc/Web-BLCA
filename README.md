# Web-BLCA
This project is the web implementation of the Bayesian Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm built by Gao et al., (2017). BMC Bioinformatics, 18(1):247. The actual BLCA algorithm, software, and paper are found at https://github.com/qunfengdong/BLCA 
The Team members of this project are Paul Okoro, Benjamin Lorentz, and John Morris. 

# Aim
The aim for the web version of the BLCA is to enable non technical savvy users to have access to this wonderful algorithm by just following a simple web user interface.
